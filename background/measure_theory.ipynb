    "In this section, we discuss the foundation of measure theory: measures and measure spaces. We begin by providing some context for modelling random experiments, such as flipping a coin, or tossing a dice. We will be using these two examples as running examples throughout this discussion. For the remainder of this section, we denote by $\\Omega$ the sample space - that is, the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment. In addition, we require the notion of a $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{X}$ (formally defined below), which represents a family of 'decidable' events. Intuitively, a $\\sigma$-algebra represents a collection of subsets of the sample space $\\Omega$ that can be assigned a measure; in the context of probability theory, a $\\sigma$-algebra contains subsets of $\\Omega$ (known as events) for which we can decide whether or not the event occured. Lastly, we require the notion of a measure (which we formally define below), which is used to assign a positive, real-valued number to each event in the $\\sigma$-algebra (intuitively, a measure is used is to measure the 'size' of elements of the $\\sigma$-algebra)."
