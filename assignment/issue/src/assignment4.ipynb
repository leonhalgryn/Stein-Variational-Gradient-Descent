    "Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) \\[[1](#References)\\] is a recently proposed variational inference algorithm with roots in Stein's method in theoretical statistics.

    "Stein's method is a three-step procedure for bounding the distance, in the form of an IPM, between two distributions $P$ and $Q$. For the remainder of this section, we assume that we are interested in the distance between a true underlying distribution $Q$ with density $q(x)$, and a target distribution $P$ with density $p(x)$. For example, in the context of goodness-of-fit tests, the distribution $Q$ may represent the true, unknown distribution undelying observed data $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n \\sim q(x)$, and we would like to test whether the data could have plausibly arisen from some hypothesised/target distribution $p(x)$. If we had explicit access to both $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ (i.e. if we had closed form expressions for both $p(x)$ and $q(x)$), we could calculate the distance between the distributions using an IPM, $d_{\\mathcal{H}}(Q, P)$; assuming the class of functions $\\mathcal{H}$ is rich enough to distinguish the distributions $P$ and $Q$, we may use the distance $d_{\\mathcal{H}}(Q, P)$ to determine whether $P = Q$. However, we typically do not have explicit access to the true distribution, $q(x)$, underlying the data. Furthermore, the target distribution $p(x)$ may be a complex distribution that we cannot evaluate in closed form, and hence expectations under $p(x)$ are intractable to compute. It is also typically the case in machine learning that we only have access to the unnormalised target density $\\tilde{p}(x) = \\frac{1}{Z}p(x)$, where $Z$ denotes the normalisation constant, in which case expectations under $p(x)$ are intractable to compute.\n",

This section introduces a tractable form of Stein discrepancy known as $\\textit{kernelised Stein discrepancy}$ (KSD). For a quick introduction to KSD, read [[Short intro to KSD - Qiang Liu]](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lqiang/PDF/ksd_short.pdf).\n",

I.e. Liu et al. \\[[2](#References)\\] takes $\\mathcal{F}_q$ to be $\\mathcal{B}^1 = \\{f \\in \\mathcal{H}: \\lVert f \\rVert_{\\mathcal{H}}^2 \\le 1 \\}$.

    "Under certain mild assumptions on the kernel $k(x, x')$ - the technical details of these assumptions are not important for this assignment; however, note that the assumptions are always valid for the RBF kernel - Liu et al. \\[[2](#References)\\] derive a closed form expression for KSD given by:\n",
