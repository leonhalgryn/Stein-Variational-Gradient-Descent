\chapter*{ABSTRACT}

In the realm of Bayesian machine learning and probabilistic modelling, practitioners are often faced with complex/intractable posterior distributions that cannot be evaluated in closed form, and hence are not amenable to use in downstream tasks. Hence, accurate approximation of such distributions remains an important and challenging problem.

Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) has recently been proposed to address this problem by iteratively applying deterministic updates to a set of particles to match the posterior distribution of interest. To this end, the particle positions are iteratively updated by following the direction of steepest descent on reverse KL divergence within a ball of reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The development of SVGD stems from a discrepancy measure used in goodness-of-fit tests that has roots in Stein's method in theoretical statistics.

This study provides a comprehensive survey of SVGD and its theoretical underpinnings, aiming to shed light on the algorithm and its applicability in practice. Furthermore, this study discusses an implementation of SVGD in reinforcement learning known as the Stein variational policy gradient (SVPG) method. A novel variant of SVPG is introduced that leverages ideas from existing variants of SVGD. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of SVGD and SVPG.

Our results indicate that SVGD shows significant promise for approximating complex target distributions, and outperforms several well-known MCMC algorithms on a simple sampling experiment.
Furthermore, the results demonstrate that SVPG and our variant thereof outperform the REINFORCE policy gradient method on classic control and Box2D gym problems.

\textbf{Key words:}\\
Variational inference; Stein's method; particle-based optimisation; kernel-based methods; reinforcement learning; policy gradient methods.
